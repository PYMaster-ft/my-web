    <p>Trademarked names, logos, and images may appear in this book. Rather than
        use a trademark symbol with every occurrence of a trademarked name, logo,
        or image we use the names, logos, and images only in an editorial fashion and
        to the benefit of the trademark owner, with no intention of infringement of the
        trademark. The use in this publication of trade names, trademarks, service
        marks, and similar terms, even if they are not identified as such, is not to be
        taken as an expression of opinion as to whether or not they are subject to
        proprietary rights.</p>
